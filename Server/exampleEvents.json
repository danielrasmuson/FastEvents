The talk will discuss some ongoing Spark Streaming work around HDFS iNotifyDStream, that will power the next-gen Kafka ingestion and more. We conclude with all the exciting things we plan to do with Spark going forward.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbstract from Tathagata Das of Databricks:<\/p> <p>What's new in Spark Streaming in 1.5 <br\/>In Spark 1.5, Spark Streaming adds several new features, with a focus on operational stability for long-lived production streaming workloads. These features are largely based on feedback from existing streaming users.  <\/p> <p>- We have introduced  backpressure support, which throttles the rate of receiving such that the system receives data only as fast as it can process.<\/p> <p> - We have improved the existing Kinesis integration such that it can ensure zero data loss without enabling the Write Ahead Log <\/p> <p>- We have graduated the Direct Kafka API from experimental API. In my short talk, I will go through each of these additions. <\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/spark-users\/events\/225244004\/","yes_rsvp_count":350,"name":"Spark and Spark Streaming at Uber","id":"225244004","time":1442367000000,"updated":1442359148000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1327082167000,"name":"Bay Area Spark Meetup","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"id":3138542,"urlname":"spark-users","group_lat":37.790000915527344,"who":"Spark Enthusiasts"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94111","country":"us","city":"San Francisco","phone":"(415) 890-HACK","address_1":"639 Clay Street","name":"RockIt Colabs","lon":-122.40374,"id":14067712,"state":"CA","lat":37.794544,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":30,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440469310000,"fee":{"amount":35,"accepts":"cash","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hello Makers,<\/p> <p>NOTE: Because of Labor Day we will be having this meeting will be on September 15th a week later than usual.<\/p> <p>We have a cool workshop for you this month.

It strictly focuses on the \"V\" in your MVC applications, and touts a blazing fast virtual DOM diff implementation.<\/p> <p><b>React is all about building reusable web components.<\/b> This is in contrast to frameworks like Angular and Ember, which use two-way data bindings to update the HTML of the page.  Some say React is easier to learn than Angular and Ember – it is much smaller and plays nicely with jQuery and other frameworks. It is also extremely fast, because it uses a virtual DOM, and syncs only the changed parts with the underlying page (accessing the DOM is still the slowest part of a modern web application, which is why the framework gets a performance boost by optimizing it).<\/p> <p>FOOD &amp; REFRESHMENTS PROVIDED!<\/p> <p>This session will cover:<\/p> <p><b>• Understand what React.js is and what problem it solves<\/b><\/p> <p><b>• Explore the basic architecture of a React.js application<\/b><\/p> <p><b>• Gain a deep knowledge of React.js components and JSX<\/b><\/p> <p><b>• Build a working application that uses React.js’s components<\/b><\/p> <p><b>• Learn React.js best practices<\/b> <\/p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.southbaymobileusergroup.com\/documents\/teamone_parking_info.pdf\"><b>CLICK HERE FOR PARKING INFO<\/b><\/a><\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/7\/2\/6\/600_440846406.jpeg\" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Grant is a business guy turned designer turned developer.

I moved to US in 2010, to pursue masters in CS in USC. My goal was to settle down and have a happy life. During college, I secured a job offer from amazon and first question my parents asked was ‘What’s Amazon’, so I explained it to them and they were fine with it. Then in few days I got an offer from the startup. Now I had to explain my parents why I am joining a 30 people company instead of Amazon. 3 months later I told them I am going to start my own company. My Parents were shocked! 3 months later I told them I am going to start my own company. My Parents were shocked! All I would say, It all turns out fine. “Life gives one chance. Take it” While in school, I had co-founded a company and just with 1000 users, we hustled to get Mark Cuban’s attention and managed to get 250K$ in funding and a bunch of press. However, our original product failed to grow. After 1 yr only 30K were left in the bank. So my startup, gave up the idea of applying for my h1b visa. Being an immigrant I had 2 things to worry about compared to my co-founders. 1] Get company on track 2] Stay in US. I feel US immigration is running Windows 95, while the economy is like iOS! I had decisions to make. Choose a job offer or work at a startup. This quote influenced my decision When I’m old and dying, I plan to look back on my life and say “wow, that was an adventure,” not “wow, I sure felt safe.” – Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub. So we persisted. An opportunity presented in the form of a PR agency who wanted to use our technology in a different way. That worked! We remained tenacious and turned around the product as Tint and we grew to 40K customers, 1M+ in revenue in just a few months. There is one thing I would say “When you fail, don’t give up. Things work if you persist and focus on product.” Coming close to losing my US visa status to growing our company to 25 employees and 4M$ in annual revenue, it’s been an adventure. Happy to share my experiences. AskMeAnything! Check out some talks by Nikhil.\" Hope to see you all there! -------------------------------<\/p> <p>Want to pitch your startup or nominate someone else?

But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way.<\/p> <p>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with<b> Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship<\/b>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.<\/p> <p>What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.<\/p> <p><b>Clean Code<\/b> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.<\/p> <p> Readers will come away from this book understanding<\/p> <p><br\/>•How to tell the difference between good and bad code<\/p> <p>• How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code<\/p> <p>• How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes<\/p> <p>• How to format code for maximum readability<\/p> <p>• How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic<\/p> <p>• How to unit test and practice test-driven development<\/p> <p>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.<\/p>","how_to_find_us":"We will meet at the Starbucks accross the street by 7:20.

It is also an experiment. Many conferences have an initial keynote session for everyone followed by a wide selection of talks running at the same time. This forces you to decide what to miss, move from room to room and the individual tracks have trouble building and maintaining context. It has been decided to do things differently for GOTO London. As an Agile in Coven Garden Group member you can get £50 off your ticket price with the code 'agileincg50'. <\/p> <p>\n\n\nTo register and check out the programme, please visit GOTO London. At GOTO London, all talks are in the same room the first two conference days. The audience has a shared context as the curated story arc unfolds.<br\/>You will not miss anything or waste time moving from room to room, and you will get to know each other and the speakers much better. The three core areas that form a story arc for the first two conference days are Agile, Lean and Rugged. In each of them, we discuss the state of the art and emerging directions that will set you up with a broad view of these key concerns for developers in 2016. <\/p> <p>The final day of the conference puts the concepts into practice with deep dives into open source tools and the latest products running alongside real user experiences. There will also be two days of workshops prior to the conference where attendees can go into depth with a specific area or technology. <\/p> <p>\n\n\nWe expect that GOTO London attendees will have an enjoyable and memorable experience learning the concepts and tools needed to be agile, lean and rugged for 2016 and beyond.
